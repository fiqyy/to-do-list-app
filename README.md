Fiqy's To-Do List: Smart Task Management App

Fiqy's To-Do List is a responsive, full-featured to-do list application built with React.js, designed to help users manage tasks efficiently with real-time tracking and insightful analytics. Deployed on Netlify for seamless access, this single-page app (SPA) provides a clean, intuitive interface for organizing daily workflows, whether for personal productivity, project management, or study schedules.

Key features include:

All Tasks Dashboard: A centralized view of every task with quick-add functionality, editable details (title, description, due date, priority), and drag-and-drop reordering.

Completed Tasks: Track achievements with strike-through visuals, completion timestamps, and archiving options to maintain a clutter-free workspace.

Pending Tasks: Focus on what's next with sortable lists by priority or due date, plus reminders to keep momentum going.

Overdue Tasks: Automated highlighting of missed deadlines in red, with one-click extensions or rescheduling to minimize stress.

Reports Page: Interactive analytics featuring a dynamic pie chart (powered by Chart.js or Recharts) visualizing task distribution—e.g., completed vs. pending vs. overdue percentages—along with summary stats like completion rates and productivity trends over time.

Built with modern best practices, the app leverages React hooks for state management (e.g., useState, useEffect), localStorage for persistent data, and custom CSS modules for sleek, mobile-first styling. Future enhancements could include user authentication, cloud sync via Firebase, or team collaboration.
